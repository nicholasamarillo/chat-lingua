# Chat Lingua

## What is this project about?
This is a project that I thought of when I was trying to find some people to learn and practice my spanish. Of course, many people have difficulty dealing with the pressure of learning a new language and practicing with a total stranger where the possibility of embarrasing yourself is a likely outcome. Chat Lingua uses the Chat GPT API so the user can practice their communication skills with an AI whenever and wherever they would like. Of course they can ask questions, tell stories, and play through scenarios to level up their spanish speaking skills.

In its current state, Chat Lingua only uses text based communication between the user and the AI. The user selects what laguage they want to communicate in and what type of scenario they would like to expereince. In the future, I would like to see if spoken messages from the client could be sent as well as text based messages. I would also like to see if I could get the API to vocalize its resonses to increade the immersion that a person learing a new language requires to expedite their learning.
